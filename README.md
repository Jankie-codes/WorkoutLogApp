# My Personal Project: *Workout and Progress Log*

## Basic Application Purpose and Functions

This application will be designed to **track weightlifters' strength and progress over time**. After a workout, users 
will be able to record their completed exercises (e.g. squat, bench press), number of repetitions done, as well as any 
additional notes (e.g. comments on lifting technique) they would like to add. 

Using this data, the application will be able to:
- Show past workout history
- Calculate one-rep maxes* for any given lift
- Determine whether the user is strong for their body weight at any particular lift

(Not an exhaustive list of features)

As previously mentioned, this application is designed for and will mostly be used by **weightlifters** and **those 
trying to improve physical strength in the gym**.

*Note: *one-rep max* means the maximum amount of weight that someone can lift for one repetition, at any particular lift 
(e.g. squat, deadlift, bench press).

## Interests in This Project

Tracking workouts is essential to ensuring progress in the gym and becoming a successful lifter. As a weightlifter for 
one year now, I have been logging all my workouts in a single Apple notes file on my phone. However, as I added
more and more workouts into that file, it became increasingly harder to navigate through. In fact, I already have to 
spend around five seconds just to scroll down to the bottom of the file and begin logging a new workout. 

With this Java application, I aim to make logging workouts and tracking gym progress easy. I (and other lifters) will no
longer have to rely on Apple Notes to do so.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to log/add an exercise set and specify the type of movement, total weight, 
total repetitions, and date.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a full workout history.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my one-rep maxes for each type of lift.
- As a user, I want to be able to see whether I am strong for my body weight at any particular lift.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my PRs over time for any particular lift.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my previous workout data to file (if I so choose).
- As a user, I want to be able to load my previous workout data from file (if I so choose).

## Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to adding sets to a workout by clicking the "Add set" button on the
sidebar, filling in information for the exercise, weight, reps, and date, and clicking the "Add set" button below to 
process the information.
